# Interactive Resume (js-resume)

This project is an interactive resume built with **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery**.  
It demonstrates responsive design principles, accessibility (a11y), and user experience (UX/UI) practices.  
The resume includes structured sections for identity, contact information, work experience, education, and skills.  

## Features
- Responsive design with Bootstrap (mobile-first approach).  
- Interactive navigation with smooth scrolling.  
- Scroll-to-top button with visibility control.  
- Contact form with real-time validation.  
- Skill tags with click and keyboard interactions.  
- Fade-in animations for cards when entering the viewport.  
- jQuery events implemented with **onClick** and **onChange**.  

## Styling
The CSS is at an intermediate level, but the project highlights how much can be achieved with **simple HTML and JavaScript code**, encouraging exploration and creativity.
